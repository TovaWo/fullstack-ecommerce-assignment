# fullstack-ecommerce-assignment

This is a fullstack project that includes:
- Frontend built with **React + Vite + TypeScript**
- Backend API in **Node.js** (handling orders)
- Backend API in **.NET 8** (handling product categories)

The frontend fetches categories from the .NET server and submits orders to the Node.js server.



## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TovaWo/fullstack-ecommerce-assignment.git
```


This project is split into three main parts:

- [Frontend - ordersApp (React)](./ordersApp/README.md)
- [Backend - ordersApi (NodeJS)](./ordersApi/README.md)
- [Backend - categoriesApi (.NET 8)](./categoriesApi/README.md)

Each folder contains its own README with specific setup and usage instructions.

### üìù Notes
- Ensure that all three services (React frontend, Node.js backend, and .NET backend) are running in parallel.
- Verify that both backend servers are running on the correct ports, as defined in the `.env` file (see each service's README for details).
